# SuitTextures

This mod lets you choose your suit texture via face customiser machine to enchance your look with some fancy textures. Some textures may be weird because non-pattern texutres doesn't fit well on suit, but i hope they still look fine. 
Note that suit upon having different texture will not use Old World's shader to fit surrounding enviroment because when you apply suit texture to your suit, it's shader is being changed to one that supports having extra texture (which is what used by this mod to apply suit textures).
*Mod also works fine with MoreColors and SuitColors, so feel free to use them!*
